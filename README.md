# hackathons
All projects from hackathons that I've participated in.

## [Translate.java](https://github.com/kevinfengcs88/hackathons/blob/main/Translate.java) (Moe's Code)
[Moe's Code](https://devpost.com/software/moe-s-code) restructures the option select Morse code [translator](https://github.com/kevinfengcs88/python-projects/blob/main/AdvancedMorseCode.py) that I built in Python
into a Java program that also reads inputs through the terminal. Coded, recorded, and uploaded to a repository in one hour with [Eric Xuan](https://github.com/EricXuan02).
