All projects from hackathons that I've participated in.

## [Translate.java](https://github.com/kevinfengcs88/hackathons/blob/main/Translate.java)
Titled as [Moe's Code](https://devpost.com/software/moe-s-code), this project restructures the [option select Morse code translator that I built in Python](https://github.com/kevinfengcs88/python-projects/blob/main/AdvancedMorseCode.py)
into a Java program that also reads inputs through the terminal. Coded, recorded, and uploaded to a repository in under an hour with [Eric Xuan]()
